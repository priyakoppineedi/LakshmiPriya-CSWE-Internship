Project Title: Drone Telemetry System (Telemetry Window)

What I Built:
-> Developed a small program that simulates and displays real-time drone telemetry for 30 seconds
-> Shows Altitude, Speed, Battery Percentage, and GPS Coordinates
-> Values update every 1 second to simulate real flight
-> Designed like a professional telemetry monitoring dashboard

How It Works:
-> Generates simulated telemetry values every 1 second using JavaScript timed loop
-> Altitude: gradually increases to simulate takeoff and flight
-> Speed: randomized within operational range
-> Battery %: decreases gradually to simulate consumption
-> GPS Coordinates: change slightly to simulate movement
-> Displays line charts for altitude and speed, gauge indicators, battery bar, system status, and flight log
-> Simulation stops automatically after 30 seconds

Tools / Software Used:
-> HTML5 – page structure
-> CSS3 – dashboard design and styling
-> JavaScript – telemetry simulation and real-time updates
-> Chart.js – charts and gauge visualizations
-> Runs completely in a web browser, no backend required

Purpose of the Project:
-> Demonstrates understanding of telemetry systems
-> Real-time data simulation and visualization
-> Dynamic UI updates and system status monitoring
-> Showcases front-end development, logical thinking, and problem-solving skills
