Project Title: Drone Telemetry System (Telemetry Window)

Project Overview:
-> Developed a simulated Drone Telemetry Dashboard that replicates a professional drone monitoring interface
-> Displays real-time flight telemetry data for a 30-second mission simulation
-> Updates values every 1 second to simulate live drone behavior

What I Built:
-> Designed and implemented a web-based telemetry window
-> Displayed key flight parameters: Altitude, Speed, Battery Percentage, and GPS Coordinates
-> Structured the interface using organized panels, charts, gauges, and status indicators
-> Created a professional dashboard layout similar to real-world drone ground control systems

How It Works:
-> Uses a JavaScript timed loop to generate telemetry values every 1 second
-> Altitude gradually increases to simulate takeoff and flight progression
-> Speed varies within a realistic operational range
-> Battery percentage decreases progressively to simulate power consumption
-> GPS coordinates change slightly to represent drone movement
-> Line charts visualize altitude and speed in real time
-> Gauge indicators and battery progress bar enhance monitoring visibility
-> Flight log records system updates dynamically
-> Simulation automatically stops after 30 seconds to represent mission completion

Tools / Technologies Used:
-> HTML5 for structure and layout
-> CSS3 for dashboard styling and responsive panel design
-> JavaScript (ES6) for telemetry simulation logic and real-time updates
-> Chart.js for data visualization including charts and gauges
-> Runs entirely in a web browser with no backend dependency

Purpose of the Project:
-> To simulate a real-world drone telemetry monitoring environment that provides continuous visibility into critical flight parameters
-> To model how ground control systems track altitude, speed, battery levels, and location in real time for operational awareness
-> To demonstrate how dynamic telemetry data can be processed, updated, and visualized in a structured dashboard interface
-> To represent a simplified mission lifecycle, including takeoff, active flight monitoring, and mission completion, within a controlled simulation environment
